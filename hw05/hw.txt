CSCI 3731 - Homework 5

1.

C is not good at handling two dimensional arrays because if you pass the array to a function,
then the dimensions of the 2d array have to be specified during compile time.

2.

Generate a flat array. Basically just flatten the 2d array into one long 1d array. 
The issue with this is accessing data from a specific row and column.
Another way is the "Numerical Recipe trick". 
Basically create an array of pointers (a) that will represent that height of the 2D array.
Then allocate flat array (*a) with the size of width times height. 
a[0] will be pointing to the first element of the flat array. 
Then loop through the array of pointers and 
each pointer will point to an element in the flat array, based on the width.

My computer is little endian 0 1 0 0.
I use the endiantest.cc to check if my computer cpu is little or big endian.
