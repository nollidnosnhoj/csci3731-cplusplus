(Enable word wrap)

1.

"Downcasting" refers to an object converting back into a subclass, while "Upcasting" refers to an object being a part of a super class. 

2.

The virtual keyword allows sub classes to override superclass methods. However, marking a method with a virtual keyword will cause it to run slower.

3.

Dynamic casting looks at the object being cast at runtime, and check if the casting is legal or not. If the casting is illegal, and you are casting a pointer, then it will return NULL. If you are casting a reference, then it will throw an exception.
Static casting works similar, but instead in runtime, it will check if the casting is legal at compile time. 
Dynamic casting is a bit slower since it has to traverse through the inheritence tree during runtime.

4.

The const cast will cast away the const in a method. An example of using this is when using someone's elses code and they forgot to makr the method argument as const. If you want to create a const object and use that method, you will not be able to. 

5.

void eat(Fruit f) is looking for an Fruit object, while void eat(const Fruit& f) is looking for a reference to Fruit, which Banana has because it's a subclass of Fruit

6.

Java has interfaces, and C++ allows a class to inherit from more than one superclass.
