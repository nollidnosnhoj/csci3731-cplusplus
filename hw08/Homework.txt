Homework 8
(Enable Word Wrap)

1.

The friend keyword allows a class to have special access to external functions, like operator overloading.

2.

Using 'using namespace std' means that you are importing std into any C++ file that includes that header.

3.

- Returning a reference to a class member. Returning an object that is part of the class will ensure that the object will not get cleaned afte the function finishes.
- Returning a copy of the object. 
- Returning an object created on the heap. Returns a pointer to the newly created object in the heap. Important to document that an object has been created in the heap so they know that it needs to be deleted.
- Use it as an argument. Instead of returning an object, take a reference to an object as an argument, and set the values in the function. 

4.

mutable keyword mark variables to be modified in const methods.

5.

- It can contains actually objects, which is great if you want the object to be unique to the class.
- References. Allow multiple classes to share the same reference, meaning that a class does not own the object.
- Pointer. Unlike reference, pointers can be null, and does not know who owns it, so keeping track of the pointer is important.

6.

A singleton is a class that can only ever have one instance. This is great for classes that only need one instance, so it makes accessing them a lot easier.
