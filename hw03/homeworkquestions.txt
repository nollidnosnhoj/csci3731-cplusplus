Homework #3

1. 

if (i = 0) means that the program is declaring the integer i to the value 0. This means that the loop will go on forever, because the program will keep on declaring i to 0. To fix this change if (i=0) to if (i==0). This compares the value in the variable i to the integer 0. This does not declare i to 0.

3. 

Since the pointer (ptr) is pointing to nothing, the scanner does not know where to store the input value. A solution would be:
int value = 0;
scanf("%d", &value);
printf("You entered %d", value);

4. 

a. int* a 
- declaring pointer a is pointing to an integer.
b. const int b 
- declaring pointer  a constant integer.
c. const int* c 
- declaring pointer  c pointing to a constant integer.
d. int* const d 
- declaring a constant pointer d pointing to an integer.
e. const int* const e
 - declaring a constant pointer e pointing to a constant integer.

& returns the pointer to the data; * dereferences the pointer.
examples:
&a returns the pointer (memory address) to the data in variable a.
*a returns the data that pointer a references.

6. 

const int* a
This declares a pointer (a) that points to a constant integer data.
The point can be modified, but the integer that the point points to cannot.

int* const b
This declares a constant pointer (b) that points to an integer.
The data that the pointer points to can be modified, but the pointer itself cannot.
